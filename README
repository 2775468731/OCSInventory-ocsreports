DESCRIPTION

  Ocsinventory-Agent is an agent for ocsinventory NG. It supports Linux,
  Solaris and AIX. *BSD support is in progress. A port to non UNIX system
  is also possible (e.g: Win32).

PREREQUISITES

  Perl 5.8. You can try the old linux_agent 1.01 if you still use Perl 5.6 on Linux)
  These modules are needed:
    Digest::MD5
    XML::Simple
    Net::IP: optional, it is only needed to compute the network information
    LWP
    Proc::Daemon: optional, only for Daemon mode
    Proc::PID::File: optional but brings the pid file support
                     if Proc::Daemon is installed
    Compress::Zlib: needed for OCS server prior 1.02
  On Linux and *BSD (i386, amd64, ia64) dmidecode is required to read the BIOS stats.
  On Linux and *BSD lspci (from the pciutils package) is required to list PCI devices.
  To get the serial number of the screen you will need one of these tools:
   - monitor-edid from Mandriva is needed to fetch the monitor. A package is avalaible
     in Fedora repository.
     information http://wiki.mandriva.com/en/Tools/monitor-edid
   - get-edid from the read-edid package
  On Solaris/sparc, you must install sneep and record the Serial Number with it :
    (download it from http://www.sun.com/download/products.xml?id=4304155a)
  On MacOSX you'll need Mac::SysProfile to collect the device informations.

BUILDING/INSTALLING

  Once the archive is unpacked, use these commands:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make install

  You can also run the agent from the tarball directory.

  The agent needs some directories to store internal settings.
  mkdir -p /etc/ocsinventory-agent
  mkdir -p /var/lib/ocsinventory-agent
  mkdir -p /var/log/ocsinventory-agent
  mkdir -p /var/run

  you can choose other directories by changing the default settings
  directly in the ocsinventory-agent file.

  You need to launch the agent with root privilege. For debugging you can
  try to launch it with the -l flag:
  eg: ocsinventory-agent -l /tmp --debug


NOTE
 
 Solaris:
  Sun Studio seems to be needed to build the dependency.
  The generated Makefile needs gmake to be exectuted

 Crontab:
  If you use the crontab to launch the agent you'll probably have to redefine
  the PATH. For example, just add something like:
  PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
  At the begining of the cron file.



CVS
You can prepare a tarball from the CVS with these commands:
   perl Makefile.PL
   make manifest
   make dist
