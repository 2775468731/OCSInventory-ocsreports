DESCRIPTION

  Ocsinventory-Agent is an agent for ocsinventory NG. It supports Linux,
  Solaris and AIX. *BSD support is in progress.
  

PREREQUISITES

  Perl 5.8 minimum
  The following modules are needed:
    Digest::MD5
    XML::Simple
    Net::IP optional, it is only needed to compute the network information
    LWP
    Mac::SysProfile 0.0.3 : this module is need on MacOSX to collect the device informations.
    To get SSL communications working (for packages deployment or HTTPS communications to 
    OCS server), you need these modules:
      - Crypt::SSLeay if you use LWP prior to version 6
      - LWP::Protocol::https if you use LWP version 6 or more
    Net::CUPS is used to detect the printer
    Net::SNMP to scan network devices using SNMP
    To enhance SNMP feature with custom networks scans, you need these modules:
      - Net::Netmask
      - Net::Ping or Nmap::Parser
      
  The following commands are needed:
    dmidecode on Linux and *BSD (i386, amd64, ia64) => dmidecode is required to read the BIOS stats.
    lspci on Linux and *BSD (pciutils package) => lspci is required to list PCI devices.
    sneep on Solaris/sparc, you must install sneep and record the Serial Number with it :
                  (download it from http://www.sun.com/download/products.xml?id=4304155a)
    To get the serial number of the screen you will need one of these tools:
      - monitor-edid from Mandriva is needed to fetch the monitor. A package is available
        in Fedora repository.
        information http://wiki.mandriva.com/en/Tools/monitor-edid
      - get-edid from the read-edid package
    ipmitool if you want to collect information about IPMI
    Nmap (v3.90 or superior) to scan network devices for Ipdiscover
    
  The following PERL modules are optional:
    Proc::Daemon Daemon mode
    Proc::PID::File brings the pid file support if Proc::Daemon is installed
    nvidia::ml brings you some informations on Nvidia Graphic Cards such as memory size, cpu speed, bios version 
    and driver version.
    Compress::Zlib

  The following module is needed if you plan to prepare a tarball or install
  directly from the Bazaar devel branch. (See SOURCES below.):
    Module::Install

BUILDING/INSTALLING

  Once the archive is unpacked, use these commands:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make install

  If you want to turn of the interactive post install script, just do (instead of perl Makefile.PL )
      PERL_AUTOINSTALL=1 perl Makefile.PL
  
  You can also run the agent from the tarball directory. In this case, use the --devlib flag to load the library 
  from the local directory.

  The agent needs some directories to store internal settings. Create the following directories:

      mkdir -p /etc/ocsinventory-agent
      mkdir -p /var/lib/ocsinventory-agent
      mkdir -p /var/log/ocsinventory-agent
      mkdir -p /var/run

  You can choose other directories by changing the default settings directly in the ocsinventory-agent file.

  You need to launch the agent with root privilege. For debugging you can try to launch it with the -l flag:
  eg: ocsinventory-agent -l /tmp --debug

  It's also possible to run directly from the tarball directory:

   sudo ./ocsinventory-agent --devlib --server http://foo/ocsinventory

PATCHES
  If you want to improve OCS Inventory, please use this github version. 

NOTE
 
  Solaris:
     Sun Studio seems to be needed to build the dependency.
     The generated Makefile needs gmake to be exectuted
     The default installation will install the binary in /usr/perl5/5.XXXXX/bin, set you $PATH variable according to that.

 Crontab:
  If you use crontab to launch the agent you'll probably have to redefine the PATH. For example, just add something like:
  PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
  At the beginning of the cron file.
