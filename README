  Once the archive is unpacked, use these commands:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make               # or 'nmake' on Win32
      make install

  You can also run the agent for the tarball directory by add
    use lib 'lb';
  at the begining of the file.

  The agent needs some directory to store internal setting.
  mkdir -p /etc/ocsinventory-agent
  mkdir -p /var/lib/ocsinventory-agent
  mkdir -p /var/log/ocsinventory-agent
  mkdir -p /var/run

  you can install the directory somewhere else. In the case change the
  default settings directly in the ocsinventory-agent file.

  You need to launch the agent with root privilage. For debugging you can
  try to launch it with the -l flag:
  eg: ocsinventory-agent -l /tmp --debug
