[READ README FIRST]

- Unzip Agent-MacOSX.zip into a temporary directory (eg: /Users/$ROB$/tmp/)
- Open up a terminal window
- cd to the the temp directory:

	$> cd Agent-MacOSX/

- Replace the file: cacert.pem with your own local version (if you're using a self-signed ssl cert for package deployment)
- Modify the ocsinventory.cfg according to your local environment

- Open up ICEBERG and browse to $TMP$/Agent-MacOSX/Agent_MacOSX.packproj
- ensure that none of the "script" links are red
- Use ICEBERG to build the deployment Package.

This package will:

- create the user/group: _ocsng with an uid/gid of 3995 via the dscl command [see scripts directory]
- install OCSNG.app to /Applications/OCSNG.app
- copy the config file to /etc/ocsinventory
- install a startup plist file to launchd
- install ocsng.log to /var/log (viewable via the console utility)
- call launchd to start the service

Assuming you don't see any errors, you should be able to open up the console utility and view the /var/logs/ocsng.log file to verify the service started properly.

Once installed, the agent should contact the server and upload an initial inventory, then go back to sleep.

Notes:

- You can't click on /Applications/OCSNG.app, it won't work (and thats the way its meant to be). Everything is called via LaunchD, the .app is just there "for show" in case it needs to be manually removed.
- To uninstall the .app, use the uninstaller.sh script. This will kill the service, remove all the users that were added and remove all the files (no restart required).
